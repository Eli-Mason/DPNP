# Introduction

This is DPNP (Decentralized Peer-to-peer Networking Protocol).

DPNP is a layer 3 protocol with the intention of decentralizing wireless networking.
Day-to-day wireless networking is designed with centralization in mind; whether it be a cell tower many phones connect to, or one wireless router for hundreds of clients. This is effective and useful for many applications; however, there are many situations where this is not the case. Oftentimes you want to share a file with someone nearby, where no centralized entity is there to facilitate the transaction. Other times, there are two (or more!) parties who would like to play a video-game, but no internet access is available, and a LAN setup is infeasable.
