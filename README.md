# Introduction

This is DPNP (Decentralized Peer-to-peer Networking Protocol).

DPNP is a layer 3 protocol with the intention of decentralizing wireless networking.
Day-to-day wireless networking is designed with centralization in mind; whether it be a cell tower many phones connect to, or one wireless router for hundreds of clients. This is effective and useful for many applications; however, there are many situations where this is not the case. Oftentimes you want to share a file with someone nearby, where no centralized entity is there to facilitate the transaction. Other times, there are two (or more!) parties who would like to play a video game, but no internet access or LAN setup is available.

DPNP is a new experimental protocol designed with the intention of facilitating peer-to-peer communications between devices through purely wireless, decentralized means. Encryption is used to enable parties to confirm the identity of the other, and ensure security. Public keys are used as the addresses to identify and communicate, and an authoritative DPNP Identity Server is used to sign public keys and assosciate them with usernames and contact information.
